# masa-diff

Telegram bot, which informs the specified channels if some of the content in specified URL's changed. The main usecase is to notify if there are new job listings on any of the specified pages. The format of the pages will change, but we will always get the information what did change. The pages' content is converted into markdown before doing any diffing.
